# Learning_Tkinter
This is a running log of my journey to learn Tkinter, a GUI library for python language.
Journey begins 7, July 2017.

After basic coding for over a year, I have a students understanding of C++, C#, and Python programming languages. With only two semesters to go before graduation and no formal "GUI" training insight, I begin a journey of research and self study.
